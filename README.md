# Restaurant


I created this project becuase i wanted to create an application that involved food and I wanted to continue to get practice working with Apis and to build something that i would enjoy.

This application uses different endpoints from the spoonacular api to retrieve different types of food.


Added authentication for signing up and for logging in to the application. This application was built with React.js, using Browser Router to send users to different routes as well as create context and provider for storing user information as well as adding, removing and clearing cart when the user submits order.

Used React hooks - useState, useReducer, createContext, useContext and useEffect

Used api.spoonacular.com api to get random recipes, as well as recipes by a certain type.

Struggles that i encountered

I overthought how to add the count of all of the items in the cart.


In the future i would like to protect routes if the user is not authemticated, so that users cannot go to the different recipes.

How to run project

1. Clone the repository 
2. Change into project directory 
3. Run npm install, to install all needed npm packages to run the application 
4. Run npm start
